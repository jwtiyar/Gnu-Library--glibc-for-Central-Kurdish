# Gnu-Library--glibc-for-Central-Kurdish
Glibc core libraries for GNU system and GNU/Linux systems, which created for Central Kurdish(ckb), can be used to all linux kernel based systems.

What is glibc?

The GNU C Library project provides the core libraries for the GNU system and GNU/Linux systems, as well as many other systems that use Linux as the kernel. These libraries provide critical APIs including ISO C11, POSIX.1-2008, BSD, OS-specific APIs and more. These APIs include such foundational facilities as open, read, write, malloc, printf, getaddrinfo, dlopen, pthread_create, crypt, login, exit and more.

The GNU C Library is designed to be a backwards compatible, portable, and high performance ISO C library. It aims to follow all relevant standards including ISO C11, POSIX.1-2008, and IEEE 754-2008.

The project was started circa 1988 and is almost 30 years old.
